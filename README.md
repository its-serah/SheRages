## 💪 Mission Statement

*"For five years, doctors met my pain with polite neglect. At twenty-two, I had a heart attack. SheRages is my answer to a world that keeps telling girls to shrink themselves. It's hope, rage, and solidarity built into something practical."*

SheRages is more than an app—it's a firewall against medical misogyny and a lifeline for those who need it most.

**Built with 💜 for women who refuse to be silenced.**
